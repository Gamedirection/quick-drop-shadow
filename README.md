# quick-drop-shadow
Add a nice drop shadow to your text strips in Blender's video sequence editor

Hi, this is a script that I knocked together in an afternoon using chat GPT.

You can learn more about why i made it and how it works at: https://youtu.be/JINxCFVuouo

Use: Select a text strip in the VSE and, using the f3 menu, search "add text drop shadow".

Limitations: 
1.If the text strip you are adding a shadow to has anything occupying tho two channels beneath it, the script will toss the new shadow strips somewhere random in your project.
2.Can't add shadows to multiple text strips at the same time.
